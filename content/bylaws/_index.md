# Bylaws of the Omaha Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America

## adopted 2025-03-17; approved by the NPC 2025-04-07.


# **ARTICLE I.  Name and Territory.**

Section 1\.  Name.

	The name of the Chapter will be the Omaha Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, hereinafter referred to as “Omaha” or “Chapter” DSA.  Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is a not-for-profit corporation.  

Section 2\.  Territory.

	The Chapter shall conduct activities in the Omaha, Nebraska Region within the territory defined by the charter granted by the national Democratic Socialists of America to the Omaha DSA.  

# **ARTICLE II.  Purpose.**

	The Omaha Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means and resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.  The Chapter is organized primarily to promote social welfare.  

	DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, ability, gender or sexual orientation, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.  

	DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources, production, and economic planning; economic and environmental sustainability; equitable distribution; gender, racial, and ethnic equality; and non-oppressive relationships.  

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one.  It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded.  It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations—recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state.  It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.  

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision.  In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic Left.  In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States.  Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society.  This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.
