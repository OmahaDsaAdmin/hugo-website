The Executive Director of the Union For Contemporary Arts, Lakesha Green has illegally fired workers for organizing a labor union and fostered a toxic & hostile work environment that led the workers to organize in the first place. Come show up in front of their building during their so-called "Union Day" Open House, and let them know that Union Busting Is Disgusting!
