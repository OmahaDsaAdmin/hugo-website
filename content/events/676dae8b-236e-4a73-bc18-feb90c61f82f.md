**EVENT START: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 8:00PM**

Every month, the tech committee meets to discuss on-going work and priorities. The objective for each meeting is for each member to come away with at least 1 deliverable they can work towards for the next meeting.This is also a good time to network, plan future projects, and discuss the role of technology in the greater socialist movement.**NOTE:** Meeting will be held at 8PM virtually in OmahaDSA Discord. Join if you haven't done so already and look for Meeting Room Marx.
