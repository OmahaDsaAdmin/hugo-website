**EVENT START: Sun, 11 May 2025 1:00PM**

Join the Omaha DSA and members of the local Omaha community as we gather to show support to Starbucks employees that are fighting for their right to fair wages, safe work conditions, and the right to unionize. It’s important to let them know they aren’t alone and that the community stands with them during this time, so join us and get a small snack and congregate with us to show support to our local Starbucks workers.
