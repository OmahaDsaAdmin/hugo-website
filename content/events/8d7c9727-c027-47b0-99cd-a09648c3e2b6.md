**EVENT START: Sat, 27 Sep 2025 5:00AM**

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is a twenty-seven billion dollar bloodsucker; a monumental monster and a pirate on the high seas of labor, and a union-buster who thinks getting paid $96 million in four months last year is more important than the livelihoods of the 900 baristas he's laying off with two days advance notice.The 72nd & Dodge Starbucks is one of the two unionized locations in Omaha, under Starbucks Workers United. It will be closing its doors on Saturday, September  27, along with 58 other unionized stores across the country in Niccol's latest attempt to bust up the labor union. Come here on Saturday from 5am to 9pm and learn how to get activated--make some signs, do some visibility, draw stuff with sidewalk chalk, and show the baristas here that you have more emotional maturity than their garbage billionaire CEO.UPDATE:This is not the only store in Omaha that's closing on Saturday. If you know of one and want to organize there, feel free to host an event on this page, which will provide a searchable list of corporate-owned Starbucks locations in the Omaha area:https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/omaha-dsa-solidarity-is-brewingUPDATE 2:The other stores believed to be closing are believed to be:90th & Fort90th & Maple72nd & L72nd and Dodge is the only unionized store that's closing. It's also right in the middle of all the store closures, which makes it a convenient staging point for other actions.
