**EVENT START: Sat, 24 May 2025 9:00AM**

This event is a weekly coffee meetup, occurring every Saturday morning from 9-11am. Attendance is drop in drop out with no RSVP required. For now this event will be at a rotating weekly coffee shop in the aksarben/Dundee/midtown neighborhoods but if this grows the intent will be to have the event simultaneously in a few different neighborhoods around town, and potentially to grow into a weeknight happy hour also to allow for those with Saturday morning schedule limitations DSA members as well as members from other leftist and left-adjacent groups are invited to come and participate in this informal social event. Casual socializing, discussion of current events and organizing efforts, theory and philosophical debates, venting about your shitty boss and requests for mutual aid all welcome. The ultimate goal is to build community and connection between neighbors and develop trust both within our group and to others outside it.
