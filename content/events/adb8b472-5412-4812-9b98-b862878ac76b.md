General Meetings are times for chapter membership to gather and discuss what we're working on, what we need help with, and what we should be aware of. Agendas typically include reports from working groups and committees, information on upcoming events, and decision points that need to be voted on. If you have never attended a meeting, please feel free to join us. &nbsp; General Meetings are usually conducted both in-person and virtually. Important: Once you RSVP you will receive an email with a link to details. Follow the link labeled, "Click here to view the event details" for specific location information and access to the virtual meeting.
