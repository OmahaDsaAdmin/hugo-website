General Meetings are times for chapter membership to gather and discuss what we're working on, what we need help with, and what we should be aware of. Agendas typically include
 reports from working groups and committees, information on upcoming 
events, and decision points that need to be voted on. If you have never 
attended a meeting, please feel free to join us. General Meetings
 are usually conducted both in-person and virtually. We strongly 
encourage in-person attendance, especially if you are new!Important:
 Once you RSVP you will receive an email with a link to details. Follow 
the link labeled, "Click here to view the event details" for specific 
location information and access to the virtual meeting.
