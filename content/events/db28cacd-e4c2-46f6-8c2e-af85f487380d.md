**EVENT START: Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:00AM**

If Starbucks won’t move on a fair contract and quit its union busting campaign, baristas are ready to strike on Thursday, November 13, right on the company's busiest sales day of the year. The most powerful thing customers and allies can do during the strike is show up at non-union Starbucks stores and turn away customers. Every conversation is a chance to grow solidarity and support baristas holding the line.
