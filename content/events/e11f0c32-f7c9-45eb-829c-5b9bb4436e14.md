**EVENT START: Sat, 31 Jan 2026 4:00PM**

This is an event for attendees of our chapter meetings to provide feedback on how chapter meetings are run. Please bring us your constructive feedback and let us know if there is a way to improve the experience of chapter meetings. All members of the steering committee are planning to be present. Due to the reservation, we are limited to fifteen attendees. There will be some appetizers provided by the chapter with the option to purchase more if you wish.
