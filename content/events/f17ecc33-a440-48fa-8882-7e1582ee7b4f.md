**EVENT START: Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:00AM**

Have you ever thought to yourself 'what exactly is Socialism?' If so, then please consider joining us for the first Socialism 101! This class is perfect for new members, and non-members, alike, who are ready to begin studying socialist theory (or for those who simply wish to be able to explain to their friends, once and for all, what the 'S' in 'DSA' stands for.)We will discuss what socialism is, and what it is not, by comparing it to the capitalist system we are living in today. We will also present some of the questions that are often a source of debate amongst socialists. This will allow us to delve into the various schools of thought which socialists, in general, and DSA members, in particular, often belong.
