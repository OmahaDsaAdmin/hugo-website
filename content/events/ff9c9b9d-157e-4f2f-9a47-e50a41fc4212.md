General Meetings are times for chapter membership to gather and discuss what we're working on, what we need help with, and what we should be aware of. Agendas typically include
 reports from working groups and committees, information on upcoming 
events, and decision points that need to be voted on. If you have never 
attended a meeting, please feel free to join us. General Meetings
 are usually conducted both in-person and virtually. This months meeting will be on zoom only please use the zoom link in the RSVP to join. Important:
