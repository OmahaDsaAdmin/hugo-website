For new members and friends of the chapter, here are some ways you can get involved and help build a better future for all Nebraskans.

But most importantly, [consider joining the movement.](/join)

## 2025 Strategic Priority: Affordable Housing

Housing is a right, not a commodity and the metro area needs housing that works for the working class. Strong tenant organizing leads to strong tenant legislation and strong tenant power.

## Have a specific interest?

Our chapter has a number of sub-groups where members can collaborate and focus on specific socialist objectives, including:

1. Labor Working Group
2. Legislative Working Group
3. Trans Rights and Bodily Autonomy Working Group
4. Direct Action Working Group
5. Design Working Group
6. Mutual Aid and Anti-Consumerism Working Group
7. Political Education Committee
8. Tech Committee
9. Membership and Outreach Committee

## Letter Writing Campaigns

As citizens, we can influence our elected officials on specific issues just by telling them what we think via letter, email or phone call. The more people who speak their mind on a topic, the more pressure we can exert on our leaders to act. But you may be wondering:

- Which bills are worth campaigning against?
- Which bills are worth supporting?
- When are these bills discussed in legislature, and when should I write my letter?
- Who is my representative?

To answer all these questions, the Omaha DSA posts "Action Network" letter writing campaign links for relevant issues and bills. [The letter writing campaigns we're supporting are listed here.](/letter-writing-campaigns)

### Get Involved

1. Click an Action Network link from our list.
2. Fill out the form and submit it.
3. All done! Action Network just sent a message on your behalf to your representative.

## Pro-Union Organizing

Do you earn a wage to to pay for essentials like housing, food, and transportation? Congrats, you're a member of the working class!

Alone, workers are isolated and weak. But by working together, we can take the power back from the rich elites who game the system.

Unions are key to this power reversal, and Omaha DSA supports the creation and success of local unions in every industry. [The unionizing efforts we're supporting are listed here.](/pro-union-organizing/)

### Get Involved

Pick a union you want to support from our list. Each one will have action items like the following:

1. Give an [EWOC booklet](https://workerorganizing.org/unite-and-win/) to an employee.
2. Visit picket lines and bring donations or snacks.
3. Invite an employee to a DSA social event.
4. Introduce an employee to a DSA member.

## Direct Actions

Direct Action is a type of activism where people act independently from existing political and/or social structures to achieve their goals. Chalk writing, rallies, sit-ins and other protests are all forms of direct action. These actions disturb the negative peace, provoke fascists into reacting, and inspire average people to get involved.

However, these actions are not always comfortable or convenient. Even peaceful protesters are sometimes attacked, both verbally and physically. Building a better Nebraska takes guts!

To counter that, remember there is safety in numbers. By showing up to these events, you make each one a little safer for everyone involved.

In addition, you don't always need to be on the frontline. Direct Actions also need people to observe, record, and report what happens. By sharing and posting the direct action, you can multiply its effects.

### Get Involved

Omaha DSA is organizing these events right now. If you want to participate in one, check our events page or speak to a member directly who can give you more details.

The easiest way to get involved is to join our chapter!
