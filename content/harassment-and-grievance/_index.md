Harassment Grievance Officers (HGO) work to help eradicate harassment in our chapter and to help transform the culture of DSA to create a space that is welcoming and inclusive to members of all genders, races, and classes and ensures that everyone is able to organize without fear of harassment, abuse, or harm.

Omaha DSA HGOs follow [the Unified Grievance Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vQDWES0fFuHwAeXvVuD3guK1wSeR9i_Xs5cRIqZ2Fv_ppKeXfyb2u7N_RLpjgPAtQ7alRk8UbKPkLdR/pub). Our HGOs will work to resolve your conflicts following these guidelines.

### How to Report Harassment or Grievance

If you are a member and need to contact an HGO or report a conflict, please use the [Harassment Grievance Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3sr41rT7DRZcEXvAaP8mEbmuy45LssmBCcvfaMM1_Tx_L1A/viewform) to make your report.

You may also send an email to [OmahaDsaHgo@gmail.com](mailto:OmahaDsaHgo@gmail.com) describing the issue, or contact one of the chapter HGOs in person.
