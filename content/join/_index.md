**To join The Omaha DSA** chapter, first you need to join DSA National. [Do that here.](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/) You will be asked to pay dues, but there are waivers available for financial hardships.

## Contact the Chapter

After you become a national member, send an email to [omahadsa@gmail.com](mailto:omahadsa@gmail.com) to let us know you're a new member in our area. We're organizing in eastern Nebraska and parts of western Iowa.
