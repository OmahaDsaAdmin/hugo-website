[3/28/25 - LB415 "Scaling Back Paid Sick Leave](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-your-state-senator-to-oppose-lb415)

**IN OUR VIEW:** LB415 would scale back the Paid Sick Leave ballot initiative so that certain classes of employees cannot accrue paid time off, including temporary and seasonal agricultural workers, workers under 16 years of age, and workers working for an employer with 10 or fewer employees. It would also make it legal for employers to retaliate against employees for taking paid time off.
