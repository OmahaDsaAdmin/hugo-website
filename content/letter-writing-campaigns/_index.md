#### [3/28/25 - Oppose LB415 "Scaling Back Paid Sick Leave"](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-your-state-senator-to-oppose-lb415)

**IN OUR VIEW:** LB415 would scale back the Paid Sick Leave ballot initiative so that certain classes of employees cannot accrue paid time off, including temporary and seasonal agricultural workers, workers under 16 years of age, and workers working for an employer with 10 or fewer employees. It would also make it legal for employers to retaliate against employees for taking paid time off.

#### [1/24/25 - Oppose LB258 "Sub-Minimum Wage for Minors"](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-your-state-senator-to-oppose-lb258)

**IN OUR VIEW:** LB415 is in direct opposition to citizen-initiated state statute Initiative 433, known as Raise the Wage Nebraska, passed by voters in 2022. Working minors in Nebraska deserve Dignity and Respect.

#### [1/10/25 - Oppose LB89 "Anti-Trans Hate Bill"](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-your-state-senator-to-oppose-stand-with-women)

**IN OUR VIEW:** LB89 would further marginalize both women and trans people, and ban specific people from school bathrooms and locker rooms, sports, women's sports in college, DV shelters, etc. This is discrimination.
