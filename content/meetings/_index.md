## Chapter General Meetings

General Meetings are times for chapter membership to gather and discuss what
we're working on, what we need help with, and what we should be aware of.
Agendas typically include reports from working groups and committees,
information on upcoming events, and decision points that need to be voted on.
If you have never attended a meeting, please feel free to join us. Held monthly
on the 3rd Monday, 6:00 PM at UNO.
