Trump's 90-day blitzkrieg assault on our democracy worsens every hour, but where are the democrats?

Schumer is on tour for his new book. Pelosi is claiming Palestine supporters are Russian plants. Jeffries is pretending to be relevant. WHERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS?

They have given up.

They've been beaten by a spray-tanned buffoon with hair plugs and tiny baby hands. They can't cope with his daily media onslaught. They can't counter his Russian-backed misinformation campaigns. When Trump goes low, the dems go high, and they lose every. single. time.

The left needs new leadership.

Where are our leaders? Where are the organized strikes, the marches, the table-pounding passion we need to mobilize the American people?

In 90 days, Trump's administration has made plenty of gaffes and mistakes, but the liberal media and democratic party continue to let him get away with it. It is clear that no traditional check or balance can contain Trump's thirst for power.

The left needs new leadership, new strategies, and new heart to overcome the rise of fascism. It's time to organize. If you feel the same, [join the DSA](/join/).
