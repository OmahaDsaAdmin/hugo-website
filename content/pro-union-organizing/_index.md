These are the unionizing efforts we are supporting in Omaha. If you would like our support to form a union at your workplace, [send us an email](mailto:omahadsa@gmail.com) with the subject line "New Union."

**THE UNION UNION:** Workers at Omaha's own Union for Contemporary Art announced their intention to unionize. A supermajority of staff signed union cards and demanded voluntary recognition at the start of the working day on February 25, 2025.

However, their efforts have been illegally stalled by management. You can learn about the illegal union-busting [via this NewsGuild post.](https://newsguild.org/a-supermajority-of-staff-at-the-union-for-contemporary-art-announces-the-union-union/)

Omaha DSA is working towards the following:

- Union Buster Executive Director LaKesha Green must resign her position.
- The Board must pass a resolution to immediately rehire any staff who wish to return who were illegally fired or quit.
- The Board must empower the new bargaining unit to seek applicants or to appoint and vote to approve the next Executive Director for the Union for Contemporary Arts.

**STARBUCKS WORKERS UNITED:** Over 450 Starbucks stores across America (and 2 / 17 in Omaha) have unionized. In response, Starbucks has bumped up worker pay by just 3%, and offered their new CEO a $100 million pay package.

Omaha DSA aims to help all corporate-owned Starbucks locations within our chapter jurisdiction.
