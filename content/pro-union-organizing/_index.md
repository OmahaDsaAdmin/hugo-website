**STARBUCKS WORKERS UNITED:** Over 450 Starbucks stores across America (and 2 / 17 in Omaha) have unionized. In response, Starbucks has bumped up worker pay by just 3%, and offered their new CEO a $100 million pay package.

Omaha DSA aims to help all Omaha Starbucks locations unionize.

**How to Help:**

1. Send [this link](https://sbworkersunited.org/take-action/) to an employee, and tell them to click "Organize With Us".
2. Visit [this link](https://sbworkersunited.org/take-action/) and "Sign the Pledge", and encourage others to do the same.
3. Give an [EWOC booklet](https://workerorganizing.org/unite-and-win/) to an employee.
4. Invite an employee to a Omaha DSA social event.
5. Introduce an employee to a Omaha DSA member.
